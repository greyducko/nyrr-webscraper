Web scraper for NYRR "9+1" Volunteer opportunities

Python implementation of a web scraper that searches for “9+1” volunteer opportunities from the New York Road Runners’ website. People are often in need of a "9+1" volunteer opportunity in order to qualify for a spot in the NYC Marathon, so this may be useful. This implementation uses the Selenium Webdriver to navigate through the web page and scrapes and saves the volunteer information found on the page in a downloadable data.json file. 

To improve on this in the future, this web scraper can be set to run at regular intervals, and potentially notify users on an email list if there are any new opportunities that were not previously there.
